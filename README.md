# edimax-EW-7722UTN_V2

Tested with EW-7612UAn v2 adapter.

Driver as downloaded from [edimax](https://www.edimax.com/edimax/download/download/data/edimax/global/download/for_home/wireless_adapters/wireless_adapters_n300/ew-7612uan_v2) with minor compile fixes

Seems to be some sort of rtl8188C / 8192C driver.

This module is not needed on raspberry pi
